To install Kubernetes on your Ubuntu machine, make sure it meets the following requirements:

2 CPUs
At least 2GB of RAM
At least 2 GB of Disk Space
A reliable internet connection

Overall, installing Kubernetes on Ubuntu involves steps such as:

- Disabling swap;
- Setting up hostnames;
- Setting up the IPV4 bridge on all nodes;
- Installing Kubernetes components on all nodes;
- Installing Docker or a suitable containerization tool;
- Initializing the Kubernetes cluster;
- Configuring Kubectl and Calico;
- Adding worker nodes.

Step 1: Disable swap
You might know about swap space on hard drives, which OS systems try to use as if it were RAM. 
Operating systems try to move less frequently accessed data to the swap space to free up RAM for more immediate tasks. 
However, accessing data in swap is much slower than accessing data in RAM because hard drives are slower than RAM.
Kubernetes schedules work based on the understanding of available resources. 
If workloads start using swap, it can become difficult for Kubernetes to make accurate scheduling decisions. 
Therefore, itâ€™s recommended to disable swap before installing Kubernetes.

Commands: 
sudo swapoff -
sudo sed -i '/ swap / s/^/#/' /etc/fstab
